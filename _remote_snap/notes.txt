Remote Snap
-----------
Python picamera based remote CLI snap app.
Takes a picture with PiCamera and sends it over the wire via TCP, and saves on the client.

Flow:

Server Runs indefinitely
    - listens for 'SNAP' command
    - returns 'WAIT'

CLIENT:
    - asks User for file name to save to
    - sends 'SNAP' command
    - receives 'WAIT' command and

RESEARCH:
- SERVER listens for connections
- Upon connection, a new 'file handling' thread is spawned

- CLIENT sends a filename as a STRING

- SERVER receives string and checks to see if file exists.
- If file exists, send back 'EXISTS ' + file size data.
- SERVER waits for client response.

- CLIENT receives 'EXISTS' response from SERVER, as well as a long of filesize in bytes.
- Prompts User Y/N confirmation
- If 'Y', send 'OK' message back to server and open a new file for writing.

- SERVER receives client response,
- SERVER checks to see if message is 'OK'
- If 'OK', open file and begin to read the first 1024 bytes
- SERVER sends first 1024 bytes over the socket.
- until there is no more data (!= ''), keep sending 1024 bytes at a time.

- CLIENT receives first 1024 bytes of data
- writes data to file and keeps track of total_received
- while total_received is less than the amount of filesize,
- receive the next 1024 bytes and continue writing to file.
- close the socket on CLIENT
